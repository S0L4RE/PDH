Maintaining your social health can be hard for a lot of people perticaly if they arent invited to stuff outside of school or if they don't have many friends. Luckily its fairly easy to overcome this challenge just ask your friends if they want to hang out after school. This is great as if you hang out with them a couple of times outside of school they are likely to think about inviting you next time they are doing something. Suddenly you will find yourself regularyly invited to stuff and meeting new people finding new friends.
